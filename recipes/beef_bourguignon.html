      <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
      <p>
        This is the speedy, easy version of beef bourguignon, the classic French
        slow-cooked beef dish. Delicious over cooked egg noodles or mashed
        potatoes. Leftovers taste great as well - just reheat on the stove.
      </p>

      <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="recipe-list">
        <li>
          2 pounds boneless beef chuck roast, trimmed and cut onto 1-inch cubes
        </li>
        <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices thick-cut hickory smoked bacon, cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 package sliced baby portobello mushrooms</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups reduced-sodium beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 pound carrots, cut diagonally into 1/2-inch slices</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
      <ol class="recipe-list">
        <li>
          Toss together beef pieces, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl. Set
          aside.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook bacon in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until fat is rendered
          and bacon is beginning to brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Add seasoned beef to
          bacon and cook, stirring often, until well browned, 7 to 8 minutes.
          Add onion and cook, stirring often, until beginning to soften, 2 to 3
          minutes. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add mushrooms and tomato paste to mixture and cook, stirring
          occasionally, for 4 minutes. Stir in broth, wine, and carrots and
          bring mixture to a boil. Reduce heat to low. Cover and cook for 40 to
          45 minutes or until beef is fork-tender.
        </li>
        <li>
          Uncover and remove 1/2 cup broth to a 1-cupp glass measuring cup.
          Whisk in flour until completely combined and smooth. Stir flour
          mixture back into beef mixture and stir constantly until thickened
          slightly, 4 to 5 minutes. Sprinkle with copped parsley and serve
          immediately.
        </li>
      </ol>
