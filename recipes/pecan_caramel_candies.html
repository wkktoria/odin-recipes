    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Salty and sweet, these candies are the perfect little snack. Form a
      kitchen assembly line with your kids, and the making becomes just as fun
      as the eating.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>54 pretzels</li>
      <li>54 Rolo candies (about 11 ounces)</li>
      <li>54 pecan halves</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 250&deg;C. Place pretzels 1 in. apart on foil-lined
        baking sheets. Top each with a Rolo candy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake 3-4 minutes or until candies are softened (Rolos will still retain
        their shape). Immediately top with pecans, pressing to spread candy into
        pretzels. Let stand until set.
      </li>
    </ol>
