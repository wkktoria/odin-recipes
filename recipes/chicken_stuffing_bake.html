    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This easy chicken and stuffing bake is comfort in a casserole. The chicken
      is tender and juicy, the stuffing topping contrasts with the creamy sauce,
      and the added onion soup mix brings so much flavor. A little bit of
      parsley on top is a nice bright note.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 boneless skinless chicken breats</li>
      <li>1 can cream of chicken soup</li>
      <li>8 ounces sour cream</li>
      <li>1 packer French onion soup mix</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 box dry stuffing mix</li>
      <li>3/4 cup chicken broth</li>
      <li>5 tablespoons butter, sliced into 8 to 10 pieces</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 350&deg;F (180&deg;C). Lightly grease a casserole
        dish and arrange chicken in a single layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir soup, sour cream, and onion soup mix together in a bowl and spread
        evenly over chicken. Sprinkle with pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine stuffing mix and chicken broth in a bowl. Spread stuffing
        mixture over chicken and top with pats of butter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until golden and bubbly, and chicken is no
        longer pink at the center, 50 to 60 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center of chicken should reat at least 165&deg;F
        (74&deg;C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Let stand 10 minutes, sprinkle with parsley. To serve, place chicken and
        stuffind on individual plates and spoon over about 1/4 cup of gravy from
        the casserole dish.
      </li>
    </ol>
